I want to resume regular blogging in the second half of 2024, focusing on my growth as a software engineering manager

I previously blogged semi-regularly from 2017-2019 but stopped due to other priorities like having two children and my habbit of getting injured after turing 30. This September, I will start a manager training course at [Hargreaves Lansdown](https://hl.co.uk), my first formal training since becoming a line manager in 2018. Blogging about my learning experiences will help me reflect and share valuable insights (I hope). My goal is to write 10 articles this year, starting with this one.

Here's to getting back on the wagon.
