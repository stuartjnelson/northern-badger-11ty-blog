## What an inclusive team means to me
An inclusive team values and respects diverse perspectives, ensuring every voice is heard and appreciated. It fosters a culture of belonging, where all team members feel supported, regardless of their background or identity. Inclusive teams create an environment where collaboration thrives, giving everyone equal opportunities to contribute and grow.

Simply put, I believe an inclusive team is one that celebrates differences, where everyone feels they can be part of shaping how the team operates.


## How is equality different from equity
At October's [Hargreaves Lansdown](https://www.hl.co.uk/) Manager Learning Journey training, I was introduced to the concept of equity in the context of inclusion. I hadn't come across this term before and initially struggled to understand the difference.

> Equality means each individual or group of people is given the same resources or opportunities.
>
> Equity recognizes that each person has different circumstances and allocates the exact resources and opportunities needed to achieve an equal outcome.

For me, as a manager, this translates to understanding that ensuring everyone has the opportunity to do something doesn’t necessarily mean I’ve created equal opportunities for everyone on the team.



## How I want to put equity into practice
My management style is very much about empowerment. Creating a culture where the team carve out their own direction. At times I feel I've been hesitant to encourage someone to take up a task if they feel uncomfortable to do so. For example not everyone feels comfortable suggesting technical ideas in a team meeting. Often due to their confidence and their own perceived lack of experience. 

I'm now going to make a conscious effort to give a stronger steer if I feel someone isn't contributing technical ideas. I'll start by raising it with them at our 1:1. I'll make sure we agree a clear goal "at next weeks engineering weekly catch-up to suggest XX idea". We'll discuss if they'd like any extra support for instance for me to set the scene around the idea. 

I feel I have done this before but now I have a better understanding of my role as the manager when it comes to equity in the team. 


## Conclusion
Inclusive teams ensure everyone feels they belong and are able to contribute to. At times this will mean I need to ensure some members of the team have extra support in order to do this.
