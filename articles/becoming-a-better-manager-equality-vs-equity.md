now I need to download this image as three different files. 1  as an optimised jpg og image, 2 as a optimised webp thats 780px wide and the 3rd as this high res version. Each file name should be the kebab case post title. The OG image and 780px wide featured files shoudl have a modifier on the end of the file name; for the `--og-img` and `--featured-img`

## What an inclusive team means to me
An inclusive team values and respects diverse perspectives, ensuring every voice is heard and appreciated. It fosters a culture of belonging where all team members feel supported, regardless of their background or identity. Inclusive teams create an environment where collaboration thrives, and everyone has equal opportunities to contribute and grow.

In more simple terms I belive an inclusive team is one where we celebrate differences and everyone feels they can be part of shaping how the team operates.


## How is equality different from equity?
At the training I was introduced to equity in the context of inclusion. I'd never come across this term before and didn't at first understand the difference.

> Equality means each individual or group of people is given the same resources or opportunities.
>
> Equity recognizes that each person has different circumstances, and allocates the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome.

For me as a manager this translate into the fact ensuring everyone has an opportunoty to do something, doesn't mean I've necessarily created equal opporunities. We are all different and different people will need differnet levels of support. In the past I've over thought "pushing" something towards a task they don't feel comfortable with. This new perspective has made me realise its something I should do more of.
