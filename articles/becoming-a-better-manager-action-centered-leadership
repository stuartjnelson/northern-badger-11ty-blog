{{ excerpt }}

During the first management leadership training session at Hargreaves Lansdown, we explored a wide range of topics, from understanding what it means to be a manager to defining effective coaching. For me, the most valuable takeaway was Action-Centred Leadership. In the weeks that followed, I found myself applying it daily.

In this post, I’d like to share my thoughts on this leadership model and how it has been beneficial in my role.

## What is Actioned Centred Leadership?
Action Centred Leadership (ACL), developed by John Adair, who was notably influenced by his experiences at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

This leadership model emphasises a balance between three core responsibilities:

* Task: Ensuring that the team accomplishes the tasks and objectives effectively.

* Team: Fostering team cohesion and ensuring effective collaboration.

* Individual: Supporting and developing individuals within the team.

Adair’s model highlights that a good leader must balance these three elements to ensure overall team success, acknowledging that prioritising only one aspect (such as focusing solely on individuals) can lead to poor outcomes for the team as a whole.

## What does Action Centred Leadership mean in practice?

As with many things in life, it's all about seeking balance. Too much focus on one area means the others suffer, which often leads to the initial focus area suffering as well. If you're only concentrating on the task, individuals won’t progress as they need to. Over time, this results in the task itself suffering due to the lack of individual development. When both the task and individual growth are neglected, the team as a whole will ultimately suffer.

In engineering, I’ve often seen this with technical debt. Focusing on delivery is commercially beneficial, but if it's at the expense of cutting corners, it will eventually catch up with you as you scale. I believe engineers are often happiest when their work is a balanced mix of product tasks and technical tasks. Technical tasks frequently lead to learning, resulting in individual growth. When the team is involved in both technical and product work, they’re likely also engaged in task planning and contributing to how the team functions, which benefits the team as a whole.


## How I scored for action centred leadership 
We were given a questionnaire to complete which gave us results for how we scored in each of the categories. It's not unlike a [Myers Briggs](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-myers-briggs-type-indicator-2795583) questionnaire I've done before. Some questions were very like others which slight variations. Ideally looking to be someone who has a relatively even score for each category.

I came out with XX task, YY individual and ZZ team. I wasn't surprised my bias was towards the team but I was a bit shocked by how much. I feel in part this is down to mt focus with my new team being, well on the team. Right now I'm less task focused as they are delivering on tasks.

I don't see it as a bad thing. Ir has been really helpful to get a new perspective on how I manage. I feel any test like this shouldn't be taken as an absolute truth but as an indication. 


## How I apply actioned centred leadership to how I manage
It's made me aware that I lean towards the best outcome for the team over the task. I can see this in how I like to not take tactical decisions at the moment. I'm making a conscious effort if we need to get something done, due to a commercial requirement I find a way to do this while balancing doing it properly.

I wouldn't say it's had a massive impact on how I manage but has given me the awareness of my bias.


## How I use action centered leadership in coaching
In coaching is where action centred leadership has has a big impact. I now often find myself saying things like "what would the impact be on the team as a result of that solution?". If I feel someone is overly focused on one area, especially the task when there is commercial pressure, it can be hard to zoom out and understand the conciquenes of that decision. In the past I've found it hard to coach in these situations as I've lacked a simple way to frame these questions. Now I find it's pretty simple! As with any good process, I now don't need to focus on _how_ I'm going to coach around these scenarios and I can focus on _what_ I should do.

## Conclusion
I'm a big fan of action centred leadership. Like with most good ideas, it's simple. In engineering the balance between delivering commercial value quickly against delivery robust solutions is hard. I feel now as a coach I've got framework I can use to help have better conversations.

Shout out to [Ade Priddle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianpriddle) from (Results Catalyst)[http://www.resultscatalysts.com] who ran the training session. Its the first formal training I've done and Ade ran the day really well. Aside from Actioned centred leadership, the other biggest take away was how Ade ran the workshop.

If you have any comments, feedback, or questions about this article please get in touch! I'd love to hear about how you understand your management style biases and how you coach others to reflect on theirs.
