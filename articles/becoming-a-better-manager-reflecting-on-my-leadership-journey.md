## How typically do you become an engineering manager? ✅
Becoming an engineering manager often seems to follow a common path where the role is awarded to those who have been with the company the longest or who possess the most technical expertise. Unfortunately, this approach frequently overlooks the importance of people skills, which are crucial for effective management. Many companies fail to provide training for aspiring managers, leaving individuals to transition into these roles without the necessary preparation. As a result, managers often struggle with fundamental people skills, such as fostering positive team cultures, giving constructive feedback, and navigating difficult conversations. This can lead to teams that are technically strong but lack cohesion, morale, and clear direction.

This is just my take, but I feel it's a fair summary. I've been fortunate to have some really good managers, but I've also been managed by individuals who, despite having many years of experience, didn't seem to possess the skills to work effectively with me. Having a poor manager is the [one of the most common reasons why people leave a role](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220111005272/en/Warning-to-Managers-Survey-Shows-Most-Workers-Will-Quit-a-Bad-Boss).

Back to the question at hand, it’s usually because you have the most years under your belt, either at that company or in engineering experience.


## How I became an engineering manager
TL;DR: I believe I was given the role partly due to my soft skills, partly because of my passion for discussing engineering, and also because I had "enough years under my belt." I've alternated between management and individual contributor roles. It took about three years for me to start feeling comfortable in management and around five years to truly gain confidence in my abilities.


### 2018 - First management opportunity
In 2018, I returned to Bath, England, after spending a year in Canada. After exploring various opportunities, I accepted a position at a small creative agency in Bath called Ready, which had a team of just 11 people. I quickly built a positive working relationship with the owners, and they soon asked me to manage the two engineers we were planning to hire. Having mentored engineers in the past, I felt ready to take on the challenge of management. It probably helped that one of the hires was someone I had worked with before (shout out to Anthony).

I’ve always believed that I have strong people skills and the ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical audiences. My passion for processes and coding standards, areas where the engineering team had limited experience, likely set me apart as a candidate for management. I was grateful for the opportunity.

Unfortunately, we eventually had to let one of the engineers go. This was a challenging process for me, both emotionally and in terms of questioning my abilities as a manager. While I believe we made the right decision—it wasn’t the right role for the individual, and we provided ample opportunities for improvement—I struggled with asking for support early on, delivering direct feedback to my report, and safeguarding my own well-being. These challenges made me hesitant about continuing in a management role. So when it came to looking for my next role, I opted to return to an individual contributor position.



### 2019-2020 - Individual contributor and management take 2 ❓
After being made redundant I felt I landed on my feet working at Studee, a education start-up. There were just four of us; BE engineer, QA engineer, lead engineer who also worked on the middleware and myself on the FE. Both the engineering team and the wider team were awesome and I was loving coding again "full time". 10 months in the engineering team was growing and the leadership team  (CEO/COO/Lead engineer) asked if I'd like to be the lead FE engineer. At first I refused very quickly. I was scared from my previous experience and was really loving coding. Lee, our lead engineer had created a fantastic environment. He had really helped me grow as a more well rounded engineer as well as given me space do deepen my [front-of-frontend](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/) skills. They gave me some time to reflect and after discussing it more with Lee I said I'd be happy to give management another shot. He believed I could do a good job and wanted to give me the opportunity. 

Fast forward a few months, the first hire I'd made we had to let go. They were not pulling their weight and make contributions. This time it was quite drawn out and again really affected me personally. Throw in crazy COVID times, my wife being pregnant and it had all become too much. I had to take a week off after we'd had the dismissal call. Again, I  had excellent support from the company and feel we made the correct decisions for everyone. While I felt it was a little easier to have conversations about poor performance this time, I was a long way from feeling comfortable.

I did continue in the role and felt I'd made some progression. I got better at running one-on-one, I become more confident in giving feedback and got good experience making architectural decisions the the other lead engineers.

Once again though when it came to looking for a new role I was keen to be an individual contributor again. In part because I wanted to code more as well as feeling draining from managing. 


### 2021 - A break from management, a horror show experience of being managed and them back to it again ❓
By now I'm sure you're thinking; "why do you keep doing management if you don't enjoy it"? A fair question dear reader and the only answer I can give is that I am very competitive with myself. I take on challenges that I can't do because the feeling of accomplishing it drives me.

I took a new role writing FE code with Vue.js 2, my favourite JS framework at the time. After about six weeks I left the role due to the Lead FE Engineer being a poor manager. I feel I've learnt as much from poor managers a I have from the good ones I've had. This person was a classic example of "first in the door gets promoted". I don't blame anyone, on paper it was a logical decision. They had more experience than me and wanted to manage. They were not a good communicator or colleague, After completing a task where my brief was given via Slack, "make a show/hide password input button", the feedback I got was "this component makes me want to poke my eyes out with glass". From this point on I tried to turn the situation around but ultimately working with them was having a negative impact on me. Combine this with having ruptured my achilles and having a five month old baby I'd had enough.

What I can say is the Lead engineer and CEO were amazing. They really supported me and in the end the manager I had left and I came back. The way the senior leadership supported me has always stayed with me as an example of good management. Getting my manager and I on a call to talk about how we worked together with the focus on the meeting not being "you said this/you did that". The CEO stating to me "no one in my company will behave like this. Backing up company values so they were much more than a statement from the execs. 

When I returned we brough on two FE contractors and over the course of four or five months I became the leader of our little team. I strangely felt like I wanted to manage again and made this clear to the lead engineer. We regularly caught up and gave me clear objectives to prove I could do the job before giving me the badge. 

The story from this period of my career was learning from other managers how not to manage as well as how to manage. I learn best from others and this was a real period of professional development for me.


### 2022 - Starting to get the hang of it. Having WAY better devs in my team ❓
I got given the opportunity to lead the FE team. We were growing quite quickly using a company called [Intellias](https://intellias.com/) to help us scale. We were growing a remote team in Ukraine of four engineers. Then the war started in Ukraine. I will never forgot the tales the team told me of fleeing conflict and their resolve during unimaginable stress. Kosta, Yurii, Vadym and Oleh were not only great engineers but incredibly resilient individuals. I'd like to write more about working with them in the future. If you are looking to hire some engineers let me know and I'll do an intro.

I had a new challenge managing a team that was remote in another country. This meant some cultural differences for me and having to establish relationships without meeting in person. The real learning curve for me was managing a team where the engineers had a deeper knowledge of our tech stack than I did. At first I didn't handle this very well. I tried to be too dictatorial in my approach. It took me about two weeks to figure out not only were the ideas the team suggestions better than some of mine but also I would have _hated_ to have been managed by someone who clearly lacked the deep technical knowledge but also wasn't listening to my ideas. 

I then drastically changed tack. Rather than dictating ideas I ran workshops where as the manager I set out the objectives for the meeting. Rather than me giving out my ideas I was facilitating conversion in the group, summarising actions and then following up by enabling our approach. It meant I spent a lot less time feeding back on the small things and instead focused on higher level decisions. I was enabling the team with my time in Jira over spending lots of time giving feedback on merge requests. This coincided with us working with an excellent consultancy company. I started working with a hero of mine, [Darren West](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwest/) who was very much about this approach. He installed confidence in me by giving clear, early feedback both about what I did well as well as how I could improve.

The combination of being (Servant leader)[https://www.harmonycrew.com/its-servant-not-subservient/], having an excellent engineering team, great leadership & product support, I was for the first time starting to feel like a real leader. Not the worried over-thinker I had been in the past. I was creating my own management style which is very much what I still use today. 

I feel its all about empowering the team rather than dictating how the team should function. I'll go into this in more detail in the future but it would be remiss of me not to throw out there THE GREATEST squad name of all time; Archie's Fan Club. Archie being Kosta's legendary dog who kept him company during some challenging time during the war. Archie is a hero to me and everyone who was part of our team.

### 2023 - first time I felt comfortable. design system team. challenging HR processes ❓
I was approach about a job that was too good to turn down, so I moved onto my first role at a big company, [Hargreaves Lansdown](https://www.hl.co.uk/) to lead the design system team. This was the first time I took on a new role where I'd start as a manager which was a pretty big deal for me. Rather than desperately winging it I felt confident I could be a good manager and help the team. 

I'd learnt quite a lot during my previous role for now to join an existing team as a manager. We'd had a number of engineering leadership changes and consultancy companies come into assist with our progression. I felt the most successful individuals at this focused on listening and asking questions. Shout out to Matthew Cohan/Mario DeCristofano/Darren West who I feel really demonstrated this approach to me.

Rather than dictating I spent the  first two weeks as much as possible listening, taking notes rather than making comment. I'm sure I made plenty of suggestions but I feel on the whole I tried to gather information first. I then shared it with the leadership group (product owner and delivery manager) as a high level plan. Then we started to put it into place. I ran a number of workshops from documenting state of a complexed component to visualising technical debt combined with regular 1:1 to understand engineers biggest pain points. 

What followed was a six month period of real change. As a team really defined our processes, coding standards and culture. At times I might start the conversation, especially nearer the beginning but really changes came about because someone in the team suggests it. For example we were having quite a lot of discussions in PRs about how to best use the React util, [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames). To reduce this back and forth we updated ESLint to enforce out coding standard. From identifying the issue to planing and implementing the solution. My role was to facilitate the opportunity for everyone to have a voice, identify blockers that would prevent that and work with the team to help prioritise work as per our priorities. It was not to have all the answers and dictate every task we worked on. 

We had a good product and we made it excellent. Everyone bought into being part of incrementally changing how we worked. This lead to some very positive outcomes. We lead the company in DORA metrics (albeit we weren't shipping direct to users and didn't have a BE to manage). The new CEO fed back after I gave a brief intro presentation about our team that we were "one of the most mature engineering teams in the company" despite us only being together for six months.

I've had some great mentors over last twelve months. I approached Darren West at the end of 2023 and he kindly has been helping me improve as an engineering manager. At work I've taken part in HL's mentoring program and the wonderful Kate Spalding has given up her time to listen to me and discuss life as a manager at HL away from my day job. I've always had the backing of my manager, Nick Laws and we've had some interesting challenges over the last twelve months with a number of changes we've been through.


## Conclusion ❓
This is my journey. I'm not saying it was the right way or the same as others. It is however, likely similar to many others. In engineering it's common place you "move up the ranks" as an individual contributing engineer. I've never heard of someone being a "junior manager". It's a role your meant to be able to do but how can you do unless you've had the chance to or the training?

If I started again I'd do more volunteering and coaching outside of my work role. The work I did at [Codebar](https://codebar.io/) and mentoring bootcamp students really help give me the opportunity to learn away from the pressures of work. Having mentors has also been very helpful to my own development. I feel there is a difference having a mentor who isn't my line manager. It's given me the space to work with someone who isn't in the weeds of my day job. I think of this as self development time for me as a manager. 

Finally I've been very fortunate to have my dad as my long suffering mentor. He's someone who's done huge management jobs, the likes of which I'll likely never take on. He always makes time to listen to my problems and give me ways I could approach them. More over he's very much lived by his own values and this, as with the best managers I've had is the most powerful way to empower someone.
