## How typically do you become an engineering manager? ✅
Becoming an engineering manager often seems to follow a common path where the role is awarded to those who have been with the company the longest or who possess the most technical expertise. Unfortunately, this approach frequently overlooks the importance of people skills, which are crucial for effective management. Many companies fail to provide training for aspiring managers, leaving individuals to transition into these roles without the necessary preparation. As a result, managers often struggle with fundamental people skills, such as fostering positive team cultures, giving constructive feedback, and navigating difficult conversations. This can lead to teams that are technically strong but lack cohesion, morale, and clear direction.

This is just my take, but I feel it's a fair summary. I've been fortunate to have some really good managers, but I've also been managed by individuals who, despite having many years of experience, didn't seem to possess the skills to work effectively with me. Having a poor manager is the [one of the most common reasons why people leave a role](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220111005272/en/Warning-to-Managers-Survey-Shows-Most-Workers-Will-Quit-a-Bad-Boss).

Back to the question at hand, it’s usually because you have the most years under your belt, either at that company or in engineering experience.
