## How typically do you become an engineering manager? ✅
Becoming an engineering manager often seems to follow a common path where the role is awarded to those who have been with the company the longest or who possess the most technical expertise. Unfortunately, this approach frequently overlooks the importance of people skills, which are crucial for effective management. Many companies fail to provide training for aspiring managers, leaving individuals to transition into these roles without the necessary preparation. As a result, managers often struggle with fundamental people skills, such as fostering positive team cultures, giving constructive feedback, and navigating difficult conversations. This can lead to teams that are technically strong but lack cohesion, morale, and clear direction.

This is just my take, but I feel it's a fair summary. I've been fortunate to have some really good managers, but I've also been managed by individuals who, despite having many years of experience, didn't seem to possess the skills to work effectively with me. Having a poor manager is the [one of the most common reasons why people leave a role](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220111005272/en/Warning-to-Managers-Survey-Shows-Most-Workers-Will-Quit-a-Bad-Boss).

Back to the question at hand, it’s usually because you have the most years under your belt, either at that company or in engineering experience.


## How I became an engineering manager ❓
TL'DR; I was given the role partly due to my soft skills, partly due to my passion talking about engineering and in part because I feel I had "enough years under my belt". I've flip-flopped around doing management back to individual contributor and back to management. It took me about three years to start feeling comfortable and five to really back myself. 


### 2018 - First management opportunity
In 2018 I return back from a year in Canada to Bath, England. After looking around I took a job at a small creative agency (there we just 11 of us) in Bath called Ready. I very quickly had a very positive working relationship with the owners and they asked me to take on managing the two engineers we were going to hire. I'd mentored engineers in the past and felt I was ready to give management a crack. It probably helped we hired someone I'd worked with before as part of the team (shout out to Anthony).

I feel I had and have people skills as well as the ability to break down technical concepts to non-technical people. I've always been interested in processes and coding standards which is something I talk passionately about. This was something the engineering team hadn't done a lot of in the past. I would guess these set me apart as someone with management potential. I really appreciated the opportunity!

Long story short we had to let one of the engineers go. I found this a really difficult process both emotionally as well as being unsure if I was being a good manager. I feel we did the right thing, it wasn't the right role for the individual and we gave them ample opportunity to turn it around. I feel the owners supported me really well. What I did a poor job of was asking for support early enough, giving early direct feedback as well as protecting my own well being. It put me off being a manager going forward. So when the company ran in to challenges and made the staff redundant I wanted to take a new role as an individual contributor.  


### 2019-2020 - Individual contributor and management take 2
After being made redundant I felt I landed on my feet working at Studee, a education start-up. There were just four of us; BE engineer, QA engineer, lead engineer who also worked on the middleware and myself on the FE. Both the engineering team and the wider team were awesome and I was loving coding again "full time". 10 months in the engineering team was growing and the leadership team  (CEO/COO/Lead engineer) asked if I'd like to be the lead FE engineer. At first I refused very quickly. I was scared from my previous experience and was really loving coding. Lee, our lead engineer had created a fantastic environment. He had really helped me grow as a more well rounded engineer as well as given me space do deepen my [front-of-frontend](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/) skills. They gave me some time to reflect and after discussing it more with Lee I said I'd be happy to give management another shot. He believed I could do a good job and wanted to give me the opportunity. 

Fast forward a few months, the first hire I'd made we had to let go. They were not pulling their weight and make contributions. This time it was quite drawn out and again really affected me personally. Throw in crazy COVID times, my wife being pregnant and it had all become too much. I had to take a week off after we'd had the dismissal call. Again, I  had excellent support from the company and feel we made the correct decisions for everyone. While I felt it was a little easier to have conversations about poor performance this time, I was a long way from feeling comfortable.

I did continue in the role and felt I'd made some progression. I got better at running one-on-one, I become more confident in giving feedback and got good experience making architectural decisions the the other lead engineers.

Once again though when it came to looking for a new role I was keen to be an individual contributor again. In part because I wanted to code more as well as feeling draining from managing. 


### 2021 - A break from management, a horror show experience of being managed and them back to it again
By now I'm sure you're thinking; "why do you keep doing management if you don't enjoy it"? A fair question dear reader and the only answer I can give is that I am very competitive with myself. I take on challenges that I can't do because the feeling of accomplishing it drives me.

I took a new role writing FE code with Vue.js 2, my favourite JS framework at the time. After about six weeks I left the role due to the Lead FE Engineer being a poor manager. I feel I've learnt as much from poor managers a I have from the good ones I've had. This person was a classic example of "first in the door gets promoted". I don't blame anyone, on paper it was a logical decision. They had more experience than me and wanted to manage. They were not a good communicator or colleague, After completing a task where my brief was given via Slack, "make a show/hide password input button", the feedback I got was "this component makes me want to poke my eyes out with glass". From this point on I tried to turn the situation around but ultimately working with them was having a negative impact on me. Combine this with having ruptured my achilles and having a five month old baby I'd had enough.

What I can say is the Lead engineer and CEO were amazing. They really supported me and in the end the manager I had left and I came back. The way the senior leadership supported me has always stayed with me as an example of good management. Getting my manager and I on a call to talk about how we worked together with the focus on the meeting not being "you said this/you did that". The CEO stating to me "no one in my company will behave like this. Backing up company values so they were much more than a statement from the execs. 

When I returned we brough on two FE contractors and over the course of four or five months I became the leader of our little team. I strangely felt like I wanted to manage again and made this clear to the lead engineer. We regularly caught up and gave me clear objectives to prove I could do the job before giving me the badge. 

The story from this period of my career was learning from other managers how not to manage as well as how to manage. I learn best from others and this was a real period of professional development for me.


### 2022 - Starting to get the hang of it. Having WAY better devs in my team
I got given the opportunity to lead the FE team. We were growing quite quickly using a company called [Intellias](https://intellias.com/) to help us scale. We were growing a remote team in Ukraine of four engineers. Then the war started in Ukraine. I will never forgot the tales the team told me of fleeing conflict and their resolve during unimaginable stress. Kosta, Yurii, Vadym and Oleh were not only great engineers but incredibly resilient individuals. I'd like to write more about working with them in the future. If you are looking to hire some engineers let me know and I'll do an intro.

I had a new challenge managing a team that was remote in another country. This meant some cultural differences for me and having to establish relationships without meeting in person. The real learning curve for me was managing a team where the engineers had a deeper knowledge of our tech stack than I did. At first I didn't handle this very well. I tried to be too dictatorial in my approach. It took me about two weeks to figure out not only were the ideas the team suggestions better than some of mine but also I would have _hated_ to have been managed by someone who clearly lacked the deep technical knowledge but also wasn't listening to my ideas. 

I then drastically changed tack. Rather than dictating ideas I ran workshops where as the manager I set out the objectives for the meeting. Rather than me giving out my ideas I was facilitating conversion in the group, summarising actions and then following up by enabling our approach. It meant I spent a lot less time feeding back on the small things and instead focused on higher level decisions. I was enabling the team with my time in Jira over spending lots of time giving feedback on merge requests. This coincided with us working with an excellent consultancy company. I started working with a hero of mine, [Darren West](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwest/) who was very much about this approach. He installed confidence in me by giving clear, early feedback both about what I did well as well as how I could improve.

The combination of being (Servant leader)[https://www.harmonycrew.com/its-servant-not-subservient/], having an excellent engineering team, great leadership & product support, I was for the first time starting to feel like a real leader. Not the worried over-thinker I had been in the past. I was creating my own management style which is very much what I still use today. 

I feel its all about empowering the team rather than dictating how the team should function. I'll go into this in more detail in the future but it would be remiss of me not to throw out there THE GREATEST squad name of all time; Archie's Fan Club. Archie being Kosta's legendary dog who kept him company during some challenging time during the war. Archie is a hero to me and everyone who was part of our team.

### 2023 - first time I felt comfortable. design system team. challenging HR processes. 
Took role as a manager for first time
Spent first two weeks as much as possible listening, taking notes rather than making comments
Ran workshops about documenting state, visualising technical debt and regular 1:1 to understand engineers biggest pain points
What followed was a six month period of change. We as a team really defined our processes, coding standards and culture. We had a good product and we made it excellent. Lead the company in DORA metrics and the new CEO fed back "one of the most mature engineering teams in the company" despite us only being together for six months.
