## My high level processes - ‚ùì
1. Add idea to my ["roadmap"](https://github.com/stuartjnelson/northern-badger-11ty-blog?tab=readme-ov-file#roadmap) when I come up with it
2. To start writing the post, I duplicate my [markdown post template](https://github.com/stuartjnelson/northern-badger-11ty-blog/blob/main/articles/__TEMPLATE.md)
3. Come up with the actual title - sometimes use AI here ü§ñ
4. Draft the section titles so I have a document outline
5. Create images using ChatGPT/DALL-E
6. Use ChatGPT to optimise/resize/format images
7. Write my first draft
8. Use ChatGPT to proof my work, section by section
9. Write the excerpt and any additional meta data
10. Final checks including checking OG data using [OGraph Previewer browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ograph-previewer/ggcfeakcnodgcmmllfdbmngekljbhiim)
11. Merge in the PR and Netlify takes care of getting the post into production
12. Schedule to share on LinkedIn



## Conclusion
<TBC> - ever changing. I've spent time making repeatable tasks automated or very simple as I want focus on writing the content.

If you have any comments/feedback/questions on this article please get in touch! I'd love to how you use AI to help you carry out tasks.
