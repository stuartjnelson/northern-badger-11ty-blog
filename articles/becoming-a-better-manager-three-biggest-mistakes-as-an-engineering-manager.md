## 1. Jumping into help
Ah a classic. This came up at the management leadership training session at [https://www.hl.co.uk/](Hargreaves Lansdown) as something many of the group had expereicned. Often being a manager means you've got experience in the role your team are doing. There is a good chance you are experiecned at it. When preasure mounts it is tempting to jump in and start contributing to meet a deadline or fix a complexed problem. Often the rational the group discussed is we felt we could likely do it quicker. For some this meant they then met the deadline. For others, including myself, we told ourselves this was the best way to help the team as it would reduce the preasure.

Sitting back and reflecting on this it doesn't help long term. Sure, in the short term you might fix the problem. But the real outcome is you've taken away the opportunity for your team to work through a problem. So next time it'll be easier for them to solve it. I'm not saying you should leave your team to it when things get hard. I do feel you should suppoort by encouraging collaboration with others and through coaching. Find a way to give the team time to fix it.


## 2. Trying to be fair to everyone
I have a strong sense of fairness. I believe it's really important for everyone to have been treated equally. 

When it comes to managing a team, I believe trying to be fair to everyone as individuals can result poor outcomes for the team as a whole. For example when it comes to choosing a solution to a problem I like to give all members of the team chance to conribute. I have in the past been _too_ democratic. This means the discusion rumbles on and we lack clear direction as more vocal members of the team put out their points of view. The balance I've missed is by trying to give everyone a fair platform it can mean we spend too long discussing ideas. What the team really needs is a decsion, and when we can't find that a manager role is to step in and make a decsion. Some members may be unhappy with the approach but this is better than us lacking clear direction.


## 3. Not making time to work on myself as a manager
One of the most common topics I've discussed at 1:1s is about my reports protecting their self development time. It can be too easy to prioritise tasks we need to complete over self development. I strongly believe in working with my team to give them time to work on their own development.

Rarely though have I done this for myself. Partly, writing these blog posts is my carving out time to reflect. In the last year I've found a couple of mentors both inside and outside HL which has been awesome. I've started to block out the last hour on a Friday to write up a post for my team about the week as well as spending 15mins myself reflecting on my week. This gives me space to review what I did well and what I could have done better.
