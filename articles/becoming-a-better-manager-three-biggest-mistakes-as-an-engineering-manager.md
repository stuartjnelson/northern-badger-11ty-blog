## 1. Jumping in to help
Ah, a classic. This came up during management leadership training at [Hargreaves Lansdown](https://www.hl.co.uk/) as something many in the group had experienced. Often, being a manager means you have a background in the role your team members are performing. Chances are, you’re skilled at it. When pressure mounts, it’s tempting to jump in and start contributing directly to meet a deadline or solve a complex problem. The rationale many of us shared was that we felt we could probably do it faster ourselves. For some, this approach allowed them to meet the deadline. For others, myself included, it seemed like the best way to support the team and reduce the immediate pressure, which is both a nice thing to do and demonstrates to your team you'll muck in when things get tough.

Reflecting on this approach, however, I realised it doesn’t help in the long term. Yes, you might fix the problem in the short term, but the real outcome is that you’ve taken away an opportunity for your team to work through the issue and learn from it, making it easier for them to solve similar problems in the future. I’m not saying you should leave your team to struggle when things get tough. I believe you should support them by encouraging collaboration, offering coaching, and finding ways to give your team the time and space to tackle challenges on their own.



## 2. Trying to be fair to everyone
I have a strong sense of fairness. I believe it's really important for everyone to have been treated equally. 

When it comes to managing a team, I believe trying to be fair to everyone as individuals can result poor outcomes for the team as a whole. For example when it comes to choosing a solution to a problem I like to give all members of the team chance to conribute. I have in the past been _too_ democratic. This means the discusion rumbles on and we lack clear direction as more vocal members of the team put out their points of view. The balance I've missed is by trying to give everyone a fair platform it can mean we spend too long discussing ideas. What the team really needs is a decsion, and when we can't find that a manager role is to step in and make a decsion. Some members may be unhappy with the approach but this is better than us lacking clear direction.


## 3. Not making time to work on myself as a manager
One of the most common topics I've discussed at 1:1s is about my reports protecting their self development time. It can be too easy to prioritise tasks we need to complete over self development. I strongly believe in working with my team to give them time to work on their own development.

Rarely though have I done this for myself. Partly, writing these blog posts is my carving out time to reflect. In the last year I've found a couple of mentors both inside and outside HL which has been awesome. I've started to block out the last hour on a Friday to write up a post for my team about the week as well as spending 15mins myself reflecting on my week. This gives me space to review what I did well and what I could have done better.
