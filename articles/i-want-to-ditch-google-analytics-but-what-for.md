## The problem
I want to add analytics to my [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) blog that respects my users privacy and takes less than an hour to setup with costing me anything.


## The contenders
### Netlify Analytics
[Netlify Analytics](https://www.netlify.com/platform/core/analytics/)

### Ackee
A free, self hosted open source platform, [Ackee](https://ackee.electerious.com/) was a recommendation I came across on a [Readit thread about Google Analytics alternatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/qety61/what_is_a_good_lightweight_free_alternative_to/).

### Simple Analytics
A cookieless tool that focuses on privacy. Their free plan gives you access to the platform but with data only being stored for 30-60 days as well as your dashboard being public.
