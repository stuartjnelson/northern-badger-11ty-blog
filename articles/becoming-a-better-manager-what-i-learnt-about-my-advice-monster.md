I know when I'm being managed, I don't like being given unsolicited advice. From watching this TED talk, How to tame your Advice Monster by Michael Bungay Stanier, it really gave me perspective on how I conduct myself as a manager.

TL'DR - Everyone wins when as a manager, you ask questions rather than giving advise. 

> In the talk "How to Tame Your Advice Monster," Michael Bungay Stanier explores how our instinct to give advice often backfires, leading to unhelpful outcomes. He identifies three personas of the "Advice Monster" that can derail conversations: Tell-It, Save-It, and Control-It. Stanier emphasizes the importance of staying curious longer and resisting the urge to provide immediate solutions. By fostering curiosity, individuals can improve their interactions and leadership effectiveness, ultimately leading to better problem-solving and relationship-buildingâ€‹ [CredibleMind](https://crediblemind.com/videos/how-to-tame-your-advice-monster-or-michael-bungay-stanier-or).

As with many good ideas, I felt Michael's points were very simple. Ask questions over providing solutions. To be a good manager you don't need all the answers but you should be good at fostering conversation. I feel asking questions is something I do often but now is something I want make an effort to do by default. 

Its too easy when you feel you know the answer to feel giving your "advice" will help your report. I mean, this solves their problem straight away. The cost of this is your not giving them the opportunity to own the solution. I've felt the pressure on my time as I start to manage more people as I can't be involved in the finer details of the many tasks my teams are working on. So the time I do get with my reports I feel I get the most out of helping them explore higher level ideas rather than jumping into the small details.

Finally I feel its just a nicer way to work. Everyone wins. I've felt less pressure to have all the answers and be responsible for helping my teams with all their problems. I feel my role is to remove blockers and facilitate change. This fits right in with asking _whats the most important problem you've got to solve_ rather than on the fly ideating.
