I know when I'm being managed, I don't like being given unsolicited advice. From watching this TED talk, How to tame your Advice Monster by Michael Bungay Stanier,it really gave me perspetive on how I conduct myself as a manager.

TL'DR - Everyone wins when as a manager, you ask questions rather than giving advise. 

> In the talk "How to Tame Your Advice Monster," Michael Bungay Stanier explores how our instinct to give advice often backfires, leading to unhelpful outcomes. He identifies three personas of the "Advice Monster" that can derail conversations: Tell-It, Save-It, and Control-It. Stanier emphasizes the importance of staying curious longer and resisting the urge to provide immediate solutions. By fostering curiosity, individuals can improve their interactions and leadership effectiveness, ultimately leading to better problem-solving and relationship-buildingâ€‹ [CredibleMind](https://crediblemind.com/videos/how-to-tame-your-advice-monster-or-michael-bungay-stanier-or).

As with many good ideas, I felt Michael's points were very simple. Ask questions over providing solutions. To be a good manager you don't need all the answers but you should be good at fostering conversation. I feel asking questons is something I do often but now is something I want make an effort to do by default.
