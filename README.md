# Northern Badger 11ty Blog

My blog powered by 11ty. Its a work in progress since I've not really updated it for 4 years.

## Tech Stack

- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) - static site generator and the backbone behind the site
- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) - templating language
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - styling
- Markdown, [Markdown It](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) & [Front Matters](https://github.com/jxson/front-matters) - content
- [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) - comments on blog posts stored as GitHub issues
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - hosting
- [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) - virtual dev environment. I now only develop this site in the cloud
